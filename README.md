# Quest

### Try it out!

You can find the live version at: http://moombads.github.io/quest/

### Install!

1. Make sure you have node v4.0.0+ installed and npm v2.0.0+!
2. Fork and clone the repository!
3. Hit up `npm install`!
4. Do an `npm run build` (or `webpack` if you're one of the cool kids)!
5. Go wild! (But not too wild, the project should still run once you're done)

### Help out!

If you're looking to help or maybe just plain bored, here's a (relatively) up to date list of minor things that need to be done:
* Fix layout to be less tempremental with smaller resolutions
* Find and replace any "magic strings" with constants from `constants.js` (this may mean adding new constants)
* Write procedural generation methods for fun! Rivers, roads, anything really! These go in the `mapgen.js` file for the most part
* Weep over the frequently poorly structured code and possibly attempt to fix it
* Try to come up with a name that's original and not already taken
